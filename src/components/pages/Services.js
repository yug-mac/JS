          One thing I HATE to do is sleep on bad terms. Last night it was late, and my fault but idk I just can't sleep properly. I would rather have you in my presence, on call, even if we are saying nothing. Your presence, in an empty room could fill it up with love. I love you so much, call me ANYIME when you're free. Like every other day, I'm probably thinking of you as your reading this.
