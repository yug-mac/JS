        I made a mistake, and I am so sorry. My dumbass didn't realize you were fr until like 10 mins in our convo, which is why I was smiling like an idiot.

        It's almost been a year of our relationship, and I should know better, and I know I do know better. Sometimes in the moment I make stupid decisions (e.g. it's just LinkedIn), but know that you are the ONLY girl and thing on my mind. My favorite thing on my mind.

        I love you with everything in me. I'm sorry you felt a sense of untrustworthiness, but I'm an open book, waiting for you to read whatever you want. The one person I have nothing to hide from is you. I should have told you in the moment, and whether it be 2am in Michigan accepting like 13 other requests or what (NOT MAKING EXCUSES THO), it slipped my mind and that's unacceptable.

        People write history books so that history doesn't repeat itself. THIS, is our history book.

        I love love you, had the best time yesterday, and am so excited for our many more hangouts.
