        Hi my love, HAPPY 10. These past 10 months have been the best of my life. I love you so much and can't wait to continue to make the best memories with you. You make me feel so happy, and content with life, and I always look forward to ending my day with a great conversation with you. (Unlike some people who think fts are draining smh)
        Around this time last year we were just starting our journey together, and I am so grateful that everyione turned out the way it did. I can't wait to spend the next 3 months of summer vibing with you, taking you out, and treating out.
        Thank you for being the best girlfriend in the world.

        We shall celebrate our 10 months next time I see you. Tell me the day and I do the rest.

        I love you. 
        With love,
